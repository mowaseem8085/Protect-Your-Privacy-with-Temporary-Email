## 📌 What Is Temporary Email?

**Temporary (Disposable) Email** is a short-lived email address that lets you receive emails **without exposing your real inbox**.

It helps you:
- Avoid spam & marketing emails  
- Prevent phishing attacks  
- Reduce tracking & profiling  
- Stay safe after data breaches  

**TempoMailUSA** provides instant, privacy-focused temporary inboxes with automatic deletion.

---

## 🛡️ How Temporary Email Protects Your Privacy

Temporary email works on **data minimization** and **address isolation**:

- ❌ No personal identity attached  
- ⏳ Short lifespan (minutes → days)  
- 🔄 One-time address rotation  
- 🗑️ Automatic message deletion  

This breaks long-term tracking and reduces the value of leaked data.

---

## 🧠 Privacy vs Anonymity (Important)

> ⚠️ Temporary email offers **pseudonymity**, not full anonymity.

It hides your real inbox but **does not hide**:
- IP address  
- Browser fingerprint  

👉 For stronger privacy, combine with:
- VPN  
- Private browsing  
- Privacy-focused browsers  

---

## 🚫 Stop Spam & Phishing Before It Reaches You

### Why disposable email is powerful:

- Spam stays **isolated**
- Phishing campaigns lose follow-up access
- Leaked addresses become useless
- Easy to discard compromised inboxes

- 🗑️ Auto-deletion
